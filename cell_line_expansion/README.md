Tools for analysis and visualization of cell lines during the thaw and expansion phase.

Analysis of cell line characterization parameters in shake flasks include:
  - number of passsages
  - specific growth rate
  - doubling time
  - number of generations

for comparison with users choice of color-coding scheme.
